## 2. Production Strategy

### A. AI Generated Art (I will do this)
I will use my image generation tools to create high-fidelity, dark-mode-themed illustrations for the abstract concepts:
*   **Privacy**: A glowing shield protecting a browser window, dark mode aesthetic, cyber-security vibe.
*   **Performance**: Detailed fiber-optic or speed-line abstract art with a focus on "Data Flow".
*   **Icon**: A stylized `{ }` curly brace transforming into a spreadsheet grid.

### B. Authentic Screenshots (I will do this)
Since I can run your app locally, I will:
1.  Start your Next.js development server.
2.  Launch a browser instance.
3.  Load a complex demo JSON file (I will create one).
4.  Take pixel-perfect, high-res screenshots of:
    *   The Input Editor (Monaco).
    *   The Output Grid (Data Table).
    *   The "Split View" (if applicable or composite later).

### C. The Video (You will do this)
I cannot generate a video file, but I can write the exact **Shot List** for you to record in 5 minutes using Loom or OBS.

**Video Script (30-45s):**
1.  **0:00-0:05**: "Stop wrestling with JSON." (Show a file drag-and-drop).
2.  **0:05-0:15**: "JsonExport runs 100% in your browser. Your data never leaves." (Show the 'Processing' indicator flying by instantly).
3.  **0:15-0:25**: "Smart Flattening turns nested chaos into clean tables." (Expand a row in the Grid View to show nested data).
4.  **0:25-0:35**: "Export to Excel, CSV, or XML." (Click Export, open the resulting Excel file).
5.  **0:35-End**: "Free. Open Source. Private." (Show Landing Page).

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **Approve this plan.**
2.  I will start generating the **Images** (Icon, Privacy, Performance).
3.  I will run the app and capture the **Screenshots**.
4.  You will receive a folder `marketing_assets/` with all the high-res files ready to upload.
